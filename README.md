## **Indian Sign Language Detection 🤟 | Hand Gesture Recognition**  

This project uses **MediaPipe** and **Deep Learning** to recognize and classify Indian Sign Language (ISL) hand gestures in real-time. The model detects hand landmarks, extracts features, and predicts the corresponding sign using a trained neural network.  

### **🚀 Features:**  
✅ Real-time hand gesture detection using **MediaPipe**  
✅ Deep learning-based sign language classification  
✅ Works with a webcam for live predictions  

### **📌 How It Works:**  
1️⃣ The webcam captures hand gestures.  
2️⃣ **MediaPipe** extracts key hand landmarks.  
3️⃣ The pre-trained model predicts the corresponding sign.  
4️⃣ The result is displayed on the screen.
